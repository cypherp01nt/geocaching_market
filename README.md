# This is my code for a marketplace written in php

The main idea is to create a local geocaching based offgrid marketplace, where people can exchange goods.
It works but is not finished. 
I stopped development because the project openbazaar is already everything i wanted this project to become. 
So now i contribute to openbazaar.
But if you want to create your own centraliced marketplace, this is a good base.

Feel free to contact me if you have questions or need help setting everything up.
